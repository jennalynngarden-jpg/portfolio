        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Around a third of customers who join Robinhood never place a trade. User research told us that many of them hesitate because they lack the domain knowledge and confidence to decide what to invest in.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study__section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>We designed an immersive experience where the customer answers a set of questions, learns which level of investing risk is right for them based on their answers, and then is recommended a small, diversified portfolio of four exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that matches their risk level. They can then invest in that portfolio in a bulk checkout flow. To make investment recommendations as a self-directed broker-dealer, we have to comply with the SEC's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/small-business-compliance-guides/regulation-best-interest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regulation Best Interest</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study__section">
        <h2>My key contributions</h2>
        <p>I led end-to-end UX content design, provided feedback on product requirements and early designs, iterated during user research, wrote all customer communications and Help Center content, and designed the in-app customer support triage flow while collaborating with five Legal and Compliance partners.</p>
        <p>This was the first product to transition Robinhood from an entirely self-directed broker-dealer to one that makes recommendations to customers. That's a big deal! With so many eyes on the project from all sides of the business, I had to be able to clearly articulate my rationale for every content decision.</p>
        <p>The keys to our success were gradual information progression, narrative storytelling, and functional visuals aligned with content.</p>

        <h3>The questionnaire</h3>
        <p>The experience begins with introductory screens leading into a questionnaire assessing the customer's investing needs to match them with a risk level. The questionnaire underwent at least 6 rounds of revision and review from stakeholders across product, legal, and compliance.</p>

        <h3>Legal and compliance process</h3>
        <p>Hands down, the most challenging part of this project was getting Legal and Compliance approval on all of the different content pieces. I needed 2 lawyers and 3 Compliance principals to sign off on over 200 screens, a set of customer communications, and a Help Center article. I grouped these different pieces of content for approval and established a cadence for reviewing work. I balanced different communication styles, availabilities, and competing priorities across these 5 stakeholders, often meeting several times a weeks with folks to understand and respond to their feedback. I had to be able to articulate my rationale behind nearly every content decision and learn how to push back on feedback I disagreed with. It was tough, but working through it ultimately strengthened my relationships with those folks and made me a better content designer.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>We drove a statistically significant increase in first trade and long-term activity rates among our target audience.</p>

          <div class="outcome-box__metric">+3.2%</div>
          <div class="outcome-box__label">increase in first trade rate among investors with less experience</div>

        </div>

        <p>Flow completion was higher among less-experienced investors. We also saw higher adoption among women and investors under age 20.</p>

For the answers, my UX researcher recommended using a Likert scale across all questions to make them easier to answer.</p>'

We avoided phrasing the question as a hypothetical (i.e. "If your investment lost 30% of its value, what would you do?") because we saw that it introduced too much cognitive load and we observed that new investors didn\'t have a way to intuit the answer - because they had never been in that situation!</p>'

We aimed to strike a balance where we answered the customer\'s most important questions about the ETF while avoiding information overload. "has grown to be the largest stock market" communicates to the customer that the US market has a strong track record without implying future growth.</p>'

        description: '<p>Content goal: Create a template for the information hierarchy that can be applied to the other ETFs while still helping the customer feel as though each one of these screens is providing unique information.</p><p>Implementation: The first sentence of the subheader adds more color on how VTI is diversified. I opted to make the first sentence of this paragraph unique so that the customer would feel like each screen was offering new information, even if the template across them is fairly similar. The second sentence nods to the criteria that our algorithm cares about when selecting VTI over other similar ETFs. This sentence will be essentially the same across all of the "learn more" screens. The expandable rows below the subheader reflect the most common questions that customers had about these ETFs - namely which stocks are included in them and how they perform. Adding the detail on the expense ratio was a Compliance requirement, but I tried to demonstrate the relative insignificance of the fee compared to their overall investment.</p>'

In the subheader, I explicitly defined "emerging markets" and gave examples of some of the main markets that the investments in the ETF represent. I pushed for us to show VWO ahead of VEA because I think it\'s easier to explain developed markets when you\'re able to compare them to emerging markets.</p>'

Balance helping customers understand why they should invest in bonds without overwhelming them with too much information.</p><p>Implementation: The verb "balance" was intuitive to customers in research and also reflects the role of the bond ETF in the portfolio from a data perspective. The subheader speaks broadly to how bonds behave relative to stocks, giving the customer a rationale for why it\'s worth investing in them - even if they don\'t fully understand exactly what they are.</p>'

"Now we\'ll split your money" clarifies that we are the ones determining the allocation. The subheader tells the customer why we\'re doing this and why it benefits them. I opted to use "split" as a verb and a noun because "allocate/allocation" was alienating to new investors we interviewed in research.

In research, several customers said they wanted to adjust the allocation, but didn’t have a clear intention behind doing so. Providing them with a rationale behind the percentages helps them feel comfortable moving forward.</p><p>Implementation: Header immediately answers the question instead of repeating it. “Based on your answers, we calculated…” establishes from the get-go that thought went into these percentages. “help optimize your portfolio’s expected returns while taking on lower risk” nods to the two goals that the algorithm is trying to balance. Last sentence hits home on why the customer shouldn’t adjust these.</p>'
