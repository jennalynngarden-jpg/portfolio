        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Robinhood was launching IRAs, but didn’t have any way to give users guidance on what to invest in. User research showed that our users were interested in investing for retirement, but didn’t know where to start. Users who were familiar with 401Ks expected that their money would already be invested for them or that they wouldn’t have to pick their investments.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study__section">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>My product team had already developed the first trade recommendations experience for our standard brokerage account. Because we heard in early UXR for our retirement experience that users wanted help picking investments, we pivoted our roadmap to focus on building a first-trade recommendations experience tailored for a retirement context.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study__section">
        <h2>My key contributions</h2>
        <p>Because I was working with a more junior product designer, on this project I stepped up to become more of a design lead. I still owned content design E2E on the project, but I also set design timelines, represented the team in various XFN channels, and managed most of the stakeholder feedback we received.</p>
        <p>Retirement was a huge company-wide effort to launch, and it taught me how to represent the team as a lead—advocating for more prominence within the overall retirement experience, partnering closely with Compliance and Legal through challenges, and helping other teams understand the unique value prop of recs. I proved that I am truly a designer who writes—not just a writer who knows Figma.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="case-study__section">
        <h2>The recommendation flow</h2>
        <p>Structurally, we mirrored the existing first trade recommendations flow. We didn’t feel like we needed to reinvent the wheel since that flow had good conversion.</p>
        <p><strong>Content goals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Emphasize personalization:</strong> Our recommended portfolios aligned with users’ time horizons and risk tolerances, so I aimed to highlight that we had taken their needs into account whenever possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Look to the future:</strong> Because Robinhood in general is known for more short-term trading, I pushed for us to use future-oriented language and visuals wherever possible to prime users to keep this money parked in this account for the long-term.</li>
          <li><strong>Educate to build trust:</strong> We heard from users who received a first trade recommendation in the brokerage account that while they trusted the recommendation, they couldn’t really articulate how their answers to the initial questions informed the recommendation they received. Because investing for retirement is more sensitive, I advocated for adding in an educational set of “results” screens that helped them understand how we arrived at the recommended portfolio.</li>

        <h2>Recurring investments</h2>
        <p>We got feedback from leadership that we should allow customers to set up a recurring investment into their recommended portfolio. This was really tricky from a legal and compliance perspective, as we legally weren’t able to make it seem like we were giving ongoing investment advice, since we weren’t a registered investment advisor.</p>

        <p><strong>Content goals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Make it clear that recurring investments is a self-directed action:</strong> Legal and Compliance were very strict about the fact that starting a recurring investment needed to be an explicit choice and clearly labeled as self-directed. This then brought with it a user education problem, as we needed to explain this more technical-sounding legal language to our users.</li>
          <li><strong>Explain the benefit without upselling too hard:</strong> Legal and Compliance were really sensitive to any language that felt too promotional. We were able to present this as an option to users, but couldn’t seem like we were necessarily endorsing it.</li>
